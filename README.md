This is how you use the server.sh script to install Minecraft servers on Ubuntu servers quickly and easily using a menu: With this script for root, KVM and vServer, you can easily create Minecraft servers. You simply put the script in the root directory, give it execution permission with 'chmod +x' and then start the server with './server.sh'.
